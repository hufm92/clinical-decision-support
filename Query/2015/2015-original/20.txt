test.
An 89-year-old man was brought to the emergency department by his wife and son after six months of progressive changes in cognition and personality. He began to have poor memory, difficulty expressing himself, and exhibited unusual behaviors, such as pouring milk onto the table and undressing immediately after getting dressed. He is unable to dress, bathe, use the toilet, or walk independently. On examination the patient's temperature was 36.5°C (97.7°F), the heart rate 61 bpm in an irregular rhythm, the blood pressure 144/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate 18 bpm. The patient was alert and oriented to self and city but not year. He frequently interrupted the examiner. He repeatedly reached out to grab things in front of him, including the examiner's tie and face. He could not spell the word "world" backward, could not follow commands involving multiple steps and was unable to perform simple calculations. His speech was fluent, but he often used similar-sounding word substitutions. He could immediately recall three out of three words but recalled none of them after 5 minutes. Examination of the cranial nerves revealed clinically significant paratonic rigidity. Myoclonic jerks were seen in the arms, with symmetrically brisk reflexes. The reflexes in the legs were normal.
